# MARLBRIDGE v1.x — Decision Log

Version-controlled record of every material clarification asked of and answered
by the owner during the MARLBRIDGE v1.x FINAL programme (Website Completion,
All-Board Academic Foundation, Operational Readiness and Final Discovery
Audit). No secrets or unnecessary personal data are recorded here — only
routing/business decisions and the reasoning behind them.

Status values: `answered` (owner has responded, implemented), `open`
(asked, awaiting response), `deferred` (owner explicitly deferred).

## D-001 — Resend configuration status and From/To addresses

- **Date:** 2026-08-18
- **Workstream:** WS1 (Resend and enquiry completion)
- **Question:** Is `RESEND_API_KEY` already added as a Cloudflare Pages
  secret, and what should the From/To addresses be for enquiry delivery?
- **Options presented:** (a) key already set, use hello@marlbridge.com for
  both From and To; (b) key already set, different addresses; (c) key not
  set up yet; (d) not sure / need to check.
- **Recommendation:** (a) — reuse the address already shown publicly
  everywhere as `FALLBACK_EMAIL`.
- **Owner response:** Key is already set. Send From hello@marlbridge.com,
  but deliver To noumanahmed1989@gmail.com (a private inbox, not the
  public address) — given as a follow-up in chat after the initial
  multiple-choice answer.
- **Final decision:** `ENQUIRY_SENDER = 'Marlbridge <hello@marlbridge.com>'`,
  `ENQUIRY_RECIPIENT = 'noumanahmed1989@gmail.com'` (private, never shown
  publicly), Reply-To set to the visitor's own validated email on every
  send.
- **Implementation consequence:** `functions/api/enquiry.ts` rewritten to
  call the Resend HTTP API directly (`POST https://api.resend.com/emails`)
  instead of the previously-unconfigured Cloudflare Email Routing
  `send_email` binding. 7 new integration tests
  (`functions/api/__tests__/enquiry-resend-integration.test.mjs`) prove the
  from/to/reply-to values, the honest 503 when the key is absent, the
  honest 502 when Resend itself errors, and that Turnstile/honeypot/
  same-origin checks still run before any email is ever attempted.
- **Follow-up required:** None for this decision — implemented and tested.
  Live delivery can only be confirmed once the owner receives a real test
  enquiry after production deployment (see D-003).
- **Status:** answered, implemented.

## D-002 — Turnstile configuration status

- **Date:** 2026-08-18
- **Workstream:** WS1 (Resend and enquiry completion)
- **Question:** Is a Cloudflare Turnstile site key + secret already
  provisioned for marlbridge.com?
- **Options presented:** (a) yes, both configured; (b) no, skip Turnstile
  this release; (c) no, please set it up first.
- **Recommendation:** (a), if true — Turnstile is already wired
  server-side to run conditionally on `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` presence.
- **Owner response:** Yes, both are configured.
- **Final decision:** Server-side verification code
  (`verifyTurnstile()` in `functions/api/enquiry.ts`) is retained and
  proven correct via 2 new tests (fails closed on a bad token, succeeds
  on a good one), gated on `env.TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`.
- **Implementation consequence:** The SITE key (a public value, safe to
  paste in chat — not a secret) has not yet been supplied, so
  `EnquiryForm.astro` does not yet render the Turnstile widget. Until the
  site key is added, `cf-turnstile-response` will never be present on a
  real submission, so the server-side check — which only runs when
  `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is set — will fail every real submission once
  that secret is live in production, unless the widget is wired first.
- **Follow-up required:** Owner to supply the Turnstile SITE key (public
  value) so it can be added to `EnquiryForm.astro`. **This blocks safely
  enabling Turnstile in production** until supplied — flagged for the
  owner rather than guessed.
- **Status:** open (site key still needed).

## D-003 — GA4 / Search Console / Bing instrumentation

- **Date:** 2026-08-18
- **Workstream:** WS2 (Analytics and webmaster instrumentation)
- **Question:** None of GA4, Search Console or Bing verification code
  exists anywhere in the repository (confirmed by direct grep across
  `src/`) despite the owner confirming all three are "connected." What
  values are available to wire them in?
- **Options presented:** GA4 Measurement ID; Search Console verification
  method/snippet; Bing verification method/snippet; provide separately
  later.
- **Recommendation:** Provide the GA4 Measurement ID as the highest-value
  first step; Search Console/Bing verification may already be satisfied
  by domain-level DNS verification requiring no code change.
- **Owner response:** Selected "GA4 Measurement ID" as the item to
  provide, but the actual `G-XXXXXXX` value was not included in the
  message.
- **Final decision:** Pending — cannot wire GA4 without the actual
  Measurement ID. Search Console/Bing verification method also still
  needs confirming (DNS-level vs. meta-tag vs. HTML file).
- **Implementation consequence:** No analytics code added yet. Repo-side
  work not requiring this value (imagery, faculty template, academic
  coverage, governance scaffolding) proceeds in parallel.
- **Follow-up required:** Owner to paste the GA4 Measurement ID (e.g.
  `G-ABC1234567`) directly in chat — this is a public identifier that
  appears in every page's HTML source once installed, not a secret, so it
  is safe to share this way. Also need: how Search Console and Bing were
  verified (meta tag / DNS / XML file), so the right mechanism is added
  or confirmed as already sufficient.
- **Status:** open.

## D-004 — Real photography and faculty/reviewer data source

- **Date:** 2026-08-18
- **Workstream:** WS3 (Public imagery), WS4 (Faculty, authors and
  reviewers)
- **Question:** What real photography and faculty/reviewer data is
  available right now, given the brief's explicit prohibition on
  fabricating any faculty name, qualification, photo, or review?
- **Options presented:** No real faculty photos/bios exist yet (use
  licensed stock for generic scenes, leave faculty section honestly
  unpublished); owner can provide real faculty details now; a reviewer is
  available; no reviewer available yet.
- **Recommendation:** Default to licensed stock + honestly unpublished
  faculty section if no real data exists.
- **Owner response:** "use the ones from learnersacademy.com.pk" —
  directing reuse of real photography and real staff information from
  Learners Academy, which Marlbridge's own site already identifies as
  "the founding academy behind Marlbridge" / "Learners Academy — a
  Marlbridge education institution" (same organisation, not a
  third-party site).
- **Final decision:** Confirmed learnersacademy.com.pk is a real,
  operating academy (9+ years teaching, Cambridge/Edexcel/AQA, Lahore-based)
  with a public Teachers page and named leadership (Hina Mughal — Managing
  Director; Nouman Ahmed — Principal; Javed Iqbal Sabri — CFO; Junaid
  Khalid — CTO; Asif Iqbal — Marketing Head) and real subject-teacher
  photos. Before publishing any of this on marlbridge.com as named
  faculty/reviewer profiles, still need explicit confirmation of: (1)
  which of these people should be represented on Marlbridge specifically
  as teaching/reviewing faculty (leadership titles at Learners Academy do
  not automatically mean the same role applies to Marlbridge's academic
  content), (2) their exact subjects/boards/qualifications taught (not
  assumed from a leadership title), and (3) confirmation that reusing
  their photos/bios on the sibling Marlbridge site is authorised (very
  likely yes, since it's stated as the same organisation, but not yet
  explicitly confirmed).
- **Implementation consequence:** None yet — no faculty profile published
  under a real name until (1)-(3) above are confirmed, per the brief's
  explicit rule against inventing role/subject/credential detail even
  when a real photo exists.
- **Follow-up required:** Ask the owner a follow-up (see next message) to
  confirm exact subject-teacher assignments before creating named faculty
  profiles.
- **Status:** open (real source identified; role/subject mapping and
  reuse authorisation to confirm before publishing named profiles).
